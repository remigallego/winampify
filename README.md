## Overview

## Motivation

Building softwares should stay fun. This project is mostly a sandbox for me to try and improve my knowledge of React and TypeScript. It is also the first large-scale project that I'm undertaking on my own, and is in constant need of refactoring.

## Development

`npm run build-webamp`  
`npm run start`

## Requirements

You need a Spotify Premium Account to access Winampify.

## Thank you

Winamp's reimplementation is the work of <a href="https://github.com/captbaritone">captbaritone-js</a>.
